# seq-solver

## Using the seq-solver

You can use `sbt assembly` to create the JAR file. To run it use the `seq-solver` script in the root folder.
Running this script will execute all experiments in the paper.

The relevant code for encoding the experiments can be found in `src/main/scala/seqSolver/test`.
